## 📥 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-storage-dapp.git
   cd simple-storage-dapp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and specify your smart contract address:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address_here
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open in Browser:**
   Visit `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the DApp.

## 📜 Smart Contract (Solidity)
The smart contract used for this DApp is a simple Solidity contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 private storedValue;

    function set(uint256 value) public {
        storedValue = value;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedValue;
    }
}
```

## 📃 How It Works
1. **MetaMask Connection:** Users connect their MetaMask wallets.
2. **Set Value:** A user enters a number, and the smart contract stores it on the blockchain.
3. **Get Value:** The stored value can be retrieved from the blockchain using a button click.

## 💡 Troubleshooting
- **MetaMask not detected:** Ensure MetaMask is installed and properly configured.
- **Contract Address Error:** Double-check the deployed contract address in the `.env` file.
- **Network Issues:** Confirm you are connected to the correct Ethereum network.
